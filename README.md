## Seeing the Forest through the Trees

Metaphors are an essential component of communication and reasoning. In day to day communication, metaphors easily slip into the conversation such as "building the plane as we fly" to describe the feeling of enacting change as that change is being defined. Sometimes the metaphor is able to capture something more ineffable, like a personal favorite, "getting lost in the sauce".

We expect the work here to cover two parts:
- Extracting quotes from news corpora
- Extracting metaphors from quotes
